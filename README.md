# IDATT1005_2024_20 - Foodi

This is a JavaFx school project created in collaboration with 4 other students in Computer Science
at NTNU.

The application is a tool which helps the user keep track of the ingredients they have and their
expiration date. The application also recommends recipes based on multiple factors, such as
expiring dates and availible ingredients. When selecting recipes, the application creates a
shopping list with all the ingredients needed for the dish, while excluding ingredients the user
already have enough of.

Note that the project is imported from a self hosted GitLab so some information were lost in the 
transfer, such as pipelines and tags.

## Usage

With Maven installed, run 

```bash
  mvn clean javafx:run
```
